Experiment 2:Python Program to take marks of 5 subjects and display grade

Aim:
  To accept marks of 5 subjects, calculate total, percentage, and assign grade.

Theory:
  append()-->adds a single element to the end of a list, modifying the original list in-place and increasing its length by one.
  
  insert(index, value)-->places a new element at a specified position in the list, shifting all subsequent elements one position to the right without replacing existing values.
  
  Index value update-->replaces an existing element at a specific position with a new value, maintaining the list's original length.
  
  List slicing-->extracts a subset of elements from a list using the syntax
  
  Sort-->Arranges the data/numbers/alphates in increasing order
  
Algorithm:
  1)Append value in the list created/given
  
  2)Printing the index value
  
  3)Inserting a new data at a index via the insert command
  
  4)Printing only a particular set of value before,after,sliced part of a string/list
  
  5)Joining the list via "+" or "extend"
  
  6)Finding maximum and minimum value via the max,min function.

  7)Find the avaerage of the given data by counting the total number of given numbers/data and dividing it by their sum.

Conclusion: 
  With this one can find out the max,min and average value of students and maintain/manage marks.
